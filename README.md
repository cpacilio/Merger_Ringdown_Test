## Contents
The source code is contained in the [src](src/) folder:
- [ringdown.py](src/ringdown2py): contains the routines to generate ringdown waveforms and compute their signal-to-noise ratio w.r.t. a noise curve; by default, ringdown frequencies and damping times are generated by interpolation from the corresponding `.dat` files (we used the tabulated data publicly available at [pages.jh.edu/~eberti2/ringdown/](https://pages.jh.edu/~eberti2/ringdown/)).
- [cvae.py](src/cvae.py): implements the conditional variational autoencoder class, as well as the routine producing the PP-plot to evaluate the final performances of the autoencoder; the autoencoder is coded in `PyTorch`;

The [Makefile][Makefile] contains commands to generate data, train a network, test a trained network, produce a corner plot. These tasks are  implemented by the corresponding scripts in the [scripts][scripts/] folder.

The notebook [git_tutorial.ipynb](git_tutorial.ipynb) runs the commands from the Makefile. Moreover, it contains an additional section showing how to produce stats and plots to test the spin relation. The notebook was originally run on the `Google Colab` platform.

Here below you find a flowchart of the three neural network units composing the conditional variational autoencoder. The arguments of the functions `Conv1d`, `MaxPool1d`, `GroupNorm` and `Linear` are indicated according to the [PyTorch.nn](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/nn.html) official documentation.

The three units are used into the training and production steps as illustrated in the figure below
